Bonfire School creates community around design and health.

We explore topics like technology, coffee and culture. We bring together people of any background to create what they want &ndash; crafts, software, dance and more &ndash; in a place that supports personal health. Our dream is that it can become a physical school one day.

# Classes

We currently offer 3 classes on [design research](2017-03-sfpl-learn.md), [software design](2017-03-sfpl-design.md) and [software development](2017-03-sfpl-build.md) using Python. Each are foundational classes, covering the basics of how and why we use technology to help other people.

### Learn, Design and Build Software

Software can be hard to understand. It’s harder still to make software. This class aims to make learning with an industry professional fun and engaging. Through a series of group exercises we will think about the needs of others and how we can solve their problems with software.

There are three main concepts in this series, each with it’s own class.

* [Class 1: Learn to find human needs for software](2017-03-sfpl-learn.md)
* [Class 2: Design software based on human needs](2017-03-sfpl-design.md)
* [Class 3: Build software with Python using design](2017-03-sfpl-build.md)

In this series, we learn to listen and spend time with others to know what they need; we design software based on those needs and draw pictures to tell the story of what we can build; then we build software with Python and change it until it meets the needs of others.
